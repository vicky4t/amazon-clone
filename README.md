# 🛒 Amazon Clone

Welcome to my **Amazon Clone Project**!  
This is my very first project where I recreated some of the core features of the Amazon website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

The main goal of this project was to:
- Learn the fundamentals of web development  
- Practice building responsive and interactive web pages  
- Understand how e-commerce platforms work behind the scenes
